            <p>This is Mumbai's most famous tourist attraction, and you simply can’t afford to miss it.

                It was built to celebrate the arrival of King George V on his visit to Mumbai in 1911.
                
                Construction didn't actually finish until some years later, but the Gateway soon became an incredibly popular and famous spot in the city.
                
                Due to its prime location in Mumbai’s harbour, it was the first thing that most people saw when landing in Mumbai and indeed India.</p>
